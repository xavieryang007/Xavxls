BUILD AND INSTALL
=================

* To build and install, for most environments:
./configure
make
make install

* To build a native Win32 library under cygwin, use this configure:
CC='gcc -mno-cygwin' ./configure --host=mingw32 --build=mingw32 --with-iconv=no

MAINTENANCE
===========

* To build versions for multiple architectures from the same place:
- create a directory for each arch: arch-<arch-name>
- call configure and make from within each directory

* Do this when you update configure.in, or when there is an upgrade of autoconf/libtool versions:
./bootstrap
or:
autoreconf -v --install --force
then:
./configure

* To build a binary distribution, use the following commands after 
  substituting the current version number (e.g., 0.30) for <version> and
  the current computer architecture (e.g., i386)

DESTDIR="$PWD/libxls-<version>-<arch>" make install
tar cvzf libxls-<version>-<arch>.tar.gz libxls-<version>-<arch>
